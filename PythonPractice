#Python Practice. I spent sooooo much time figuring out this silly set-to list- to set practice problem
M = set()
N = set()          #Initialize sets

print("please input how many numbers you want in set M: ")
a = int(input())
print("please enter", a, "numbers you want in set M separated by a space: ")
x1 = input()
x2 = x1.split()                          
x3 = list(map(int, x2))        #converts raw input into an iterable format

for x in range(a):
    M.add(x3[x])                #Then adds to set


print("please input how many numbers you want in set N: ")
b = int(input())
print("please enter", b, "numbers you want in set N separated by a space: ")
y1 = input()
y2 = y1.split()
y3 = list(map(int, y2))

for x in range(b):
    N.add(y3[x])                  #Do it again

newset = M.symmetric_difference(N)    #Compares sets, converts back to list, sorts list...
newlis = list(newset)
stor = sorted(newlis)

for x in range(len(stor)):
    print(stor[x])                    #Then prints!
